"""CPiMLP behind the shared :class:`~agent.BaseAgent` inference contract.

``predict_at`` still takes the ``(x, y, z, t, P)`` of the contract -- every
plotting and benchmarking script is written against it -- but the ``P`` column is
sliced off and thrown away, and the remaining four columns are already the
``(x, y, z, t)`` the network takes. Asking this agent for 100 W and for 250 W at
the same point therefore returns the same number, by construction.

Beyond that it is a direct forward pass: the network is a pointwise map, so no
interpolation is involved at any query point and the volumetric ``predict_of``
inherited from the base class is the same map evaluated on a regular grid.

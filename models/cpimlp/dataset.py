"""Turn the shared point cloud into the six batches CPiMLP's PINN loss consumes.

A copy of :mod:`models.pimlp.dataset` with the laser power taken out of every
batch the network sees, which -- since the network is the only thing that took it
-- means every batch. The base :class:`~dataset.SimulationDataset` only knows
about labelled samples, while the PDE, boundary and initial-condition terms need
points that no simulation row supplies: interior collocation points, points pinned
to a face with the outward normal attached, points at ``t = 0``. They are sampled
here from the same domain the labels span.

The one place the power does not disappear is :meth:`CPiMLPDataset.top`, and it
cannot: the top-surface source term is the laser, and the laser's strength *is*
its power. PiMLP samples a power per point there, the same way it samples one for
every other physics batch, because its network is told which power it is answering
for. This one is not, so a sampled power would ask the boundary condition to
demand a different heat flux at the same point from one step to the next while the
network has no way to tell the two apart -- noise, not physics. Instead the flux is
pinned to a single :attr:`physics_power`, so the residuals describe one definite
problem. The data term still spans all seven powers, and that tension is the
subject of the docstring of :mod:`models.cpimlp.train`.

:func:`normalisation` returns a ``[4]`` mean and scale rather than PiMLP's ``[5]``
-- the same one :meth:`models.cmlp.dataset.CMLPDataset.normalisation` derives.

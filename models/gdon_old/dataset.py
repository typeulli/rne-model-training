"""Random labelled batches for GDoNOld, in the ``(power, coords)`` form its model takes.

There are no collocation, boundary or initial-condition batches here: without a
PDE residual the only points GDoNOld ever sees are the simulation's own rows. That
is the entire difference from :mod:`models.gpidon_old.dataset`.

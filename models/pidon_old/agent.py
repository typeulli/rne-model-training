"""PiDoNOld behind the shared :class:`~agent.BaseAgent` inference contract.

``predict_at`` is a direct forward pass -- the network is already a pointwise
map ``(x, y, z, t; P) -> T``, which is what makes the operator formulation
attractive here: no interpolation is involved at any query point, and the
volumetric ``predict_of`` inherited from the base class is just the same map
evaluated on a regular grid.

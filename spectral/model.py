"""The model, and the two transforms that decide whether it works at all.

Nothing here is a network trick. :class:`SpectralMLP` is three hidden layers; what
makes the difference is *what it is asked to predict*.

**Reconstruction.** The Fourier basis already carries the space, so the network
takes ``(P, t)`` -- two numbers -- and returns every stored coefficient at once. One
forward pass is a whole temperature field; :func:`reconstruct` inverts it back onto
the grid.

**De-rotation.** A source moving at ``v`` makes the field roughly ``f(x - v t)``,
whose transform is ``g(kx) * exp(-2i pi kx v t)``: every coefficient spins in the
complex plane, and the faster the mode, the faster it spins. Over a 3 s run the
energetic modes turn 15-30 times, and an MLP cannot fit a target that oscillates
like that -- left alone, it put the peak 17% low. Undoing the spin analytically,
which is a change to the frame that travels with the laser, leaves an amplitude that
barely moves in time, and the same network lands at 1.3%. It is an exact, invertible
multiplication, so nothing is lost.

The phase is evaluated at the exact snapshot times, so **the snapshot interval does
not have to resolve the spin.** A dataset whose raw coefficients alias above
``|mx| = 5`` still learns every mode out to 38. That is worth stating because the
opposite is easy to assume: aliasing stops you *inferring* a frequency from samples,
and here the frequency is not inferred, it is known.

What does defeat de-rotation is a mode that is not travelling. Above ``|mx| ~ 30`` the
spectrum is dominated by the x-wrap discontinuity -- the 41 K step the DFT sees
between the far end of the plate and the near one -- which is pinned to the domain,
not to the laser. Multiplying that by a spin *adds* an oscillation instead of
removing one, and the fix for it is to detrend x, not to sample time more finely.

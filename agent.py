"""The inference contract every model exposes through its ``agent.py``.

A trained network is only useful to the plotting and analysis scripts through
two questions, so those are the only two an agent has to answer:

``predict_at(inputs)``
    ``inputs`` is ``[B, 5]`` of ``(x, y, z, t, P)`` and the result is ``[B, 1]``
    of temperature in Kelvin. Arbitrary points, no structure assumed -- this is
    what a slice, a line cut or a scattered probe needs.

``predict_of(inputs)``
    ``inputs`` is ``[B, 2]`` of ``(t, P)`` and the result is ``[B, 1, D, H, W]``
    of temperature in Kelvin: the whole three-dimensional field, one volume per
    row. The trailing axes follow the ``Conv3d`` convention ``D = z``, ``H = y``,
    ``W = x``, so ``field[b, 0, k, j, i]`` is ``T(x[i], y[j], z[k])`` at that
    row's ``(t, P)``.

Only :meth:`BaseAgent.predict_at` is abstract. ``predict_of`` is derived from it
here by evaluating the reconstruction grid, so a new model gets the volumetric
view for free and the two can never disagree.

Spatial and temporal bounds come from the checkpoint, not from the dataset, so
plotting a saved model never touches the 13 GB corpus.
